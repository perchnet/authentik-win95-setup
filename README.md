# authentik-win95-setup

A CSS skin for the Authentik identity provider, to make it look like the Windows 95 setup wizard.

This is woefully incomplete. For a start it's only intended to theme the flow pages; it does not work cohesively with the rest of Authentik's UI but this is fine for our purposes.

Parts of 98.css were incorporated in this, and I also use some assets (fonts, icons) from Microsoft directly - probably in breach of copyright law.
